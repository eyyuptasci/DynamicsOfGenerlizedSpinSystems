# Dynamics of Generlized Spin Systems

This project was a term project aimed at simulating the dynamics of generalized spin systems as part of the UIUC MATH490 course and the [Illinois Mathematics Lab](https://iml.math.illinois.edu/fall-2024-iml-research-projects/) (formerly the Illinois Geometry Lab) research projects. The Illinois Mathematics Lab's mission is to foster undergraduate research in mathematics, creating opportunities for undergraduates to engage in research with faculty and graduate students.

This work was completed with my colleagues Sihan Chen and Ethan Clayton, under the guidance of our graduate student mentor Jason Liu and our faculty supervisor Dr. [Joseph Palmer](https://sites.google.com/view/jpalmer/home).
